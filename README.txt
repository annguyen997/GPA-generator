GPA Generator and Retrieval System

Last Updated: December 8, 2017
For Version 1

This simple Python program allows undergraduate students of George Mason University to calculate their unofficial cumulative GPA by inputting their classes and associated earned grades. This application works to help students understand their academic progress in their undergraduate careers. Please note that this program is not designed to generate semester GPAs. In addition, GPAs generated by the system are unofficial; this program cannot be used as replacement of transcripts. 

Note: There were no specific packages used during this program other than you need Python 2.7 to run this program.

2. Double click on the Group12_Nguyen_Safdar_Final_Project_Main.py.py file to execute the file. You can also right-click on the Group12_Nguyen_Safdar_Final_Project_Main.py.py, and select “Open”. 

Disclaimer Message
The program starts running with a Disclaimer message displayed. Read the disclaimer message in its entirety. You will see a statement that says “If you wish to continue with this program, type “Yes” or “Y”” (without the quotes). 

If you agree with the conditions in disclaimer, type “Y” or “Yes” after the message. If so, the program will then display the menu containing its options to calculate GPA. 

If do you not wish to continue, just simply press “Enter”. The program will automatically exit and window will close. 






			











After agreeing with disclaimer, a main menu displays like the one below: 


Figure 1 – The Main Menu

The GPA Generator and Retrieval System menu will contain the following options, summarized below:  

1. GPA Generator
This option will allow students to create a record into the system if they yet to have a record. This option will require a user to input his/her George Mason Net ID, their G-Number, and the classes and grades for each class the user wishes to enter. The program will then generate the cumulative GPA, the number of attempted and earned credits of the student, and the number of entered classes – all shown to the user. 

2. GPA Update
This option will allow students to update their GPA record by adding additional classes or updating the grade for existing classes (i.e. classes already in the system). This will require a user to input his/her George Mason Net ID and the classes and grades for each class the user wishes to enter or update. Once calculated, the program will generate the GPA to be displayed to user as well as the number of attempted and earned credits of the student and the number of entered or updated classes.

3. GPA Retrieve
This option will allow students to retrieve their GPA record and the associated attempted credits, earned credits, and number of classes taken. The user will only need to enter his/her George Mason Net ID. If Net ID matches in the record, the program will generate the report. This option does provide the capability for the user to also export the report as a text file. 

4. GPA Deletion
This option will allow students the ability to permanently delete their record, which includes the cumulative GPA and the associated attempted credits, earned credits, and number of classes taken. The user will only need to enter his/her George Mason Net ID to delete the record. The user will be asked to provide the ID twice for verification purposes before deleting the record. 

5. Exit 
When the user wishes to exit the program, this option will save all student records entered into the system while this program was active into a binary file. Then, the program informs the user that the program is terminating. The user will need to press “ENTER” to successfully close the window.  

To select an option, type the number that corresponds to the option you wish to perform. For example, if you want to generate a record and a GPA, type “1” (without quotes). If you want to retrieve the record and view it as a report, type “4” (without quotes). If you type an invalid option, the program will ask you to type a valid option. Please note for options 1-4, you can only enter information for one student at a time. 

After the GPA or report is displayed in the appropriate options (except option #5 from the main menu), the program requests the user to press Enter, which will redirect the user back to the main menu.
 
GPA Calculation 
To understand how this program calculates the cumulative GPA, you will need to understand how George Mason University officially calculates the GPA. 

To calculate cumulative GPA:
1. Ensure all classes that you have completed has a final course grade (e.g. A+, A, A-, B+, B, B-, C+, C, C-, D, F, W (withdraw) and I (incomplete). Ensure those are classes you have taken at George Mason University (classes from community colleges for example are not considered in the GPA calculations). 
2. Other grades like S/NC (satisfactory/no credit) and T (transfer) are not considered in this calculation as those classes have no impact on the GPA. Those, ignore classes that have these grade designations. 
3. For each class: Multiply the earned GPA (GPA hours), which is based on the final course grade, with number of attempted* credit hours for each class taken at Mason. This provides the total quality points (TQP). 
4. Add the TQP for all taken courses and then divide by total number of cumulative attempted credit hours (done at Mason) to get the cumulative GPA.

Formula: Cumulative GPA: (Total TQP/Total Number of Attempted Credit Hours) 

For Mason undergraduate students, the GPA equivalency calculation is as follows:
* A+ and A (4.00)
* A- (3.67)
* B+ (3.33)
* B (3.00)
* B- (2.67)
* C+ (2.33)
* C (2.00)
* C- (1.67)
* D (1.00)
* F (0.00) - Fail; no credit hours earned for failed courses (they will count as attempted). 
* W – No equivalent GPA but courses with this designation will count as attempted and will most likely negatively impact the cumulative GPA.
 
What are Attempted and Earned Credit Hours? 
Attempted credit hours include all courses that appear on the transcript, including withdrawals (W) and fails (F). (Transferred courses are not considered in attempted credit hours calculations so do not enter those into the GPA calculation. Note that future implementations of this program may allow transferred courses to be entered into the system). Completed or "earned" hours are courses with a passing grade (at least a D).

Attempted credit hours include incompletes (I) – but they also currently have no impact on the GPA as courses with this designation are not complete. Retake courses are counted as attempted credits, but the GPA and any satisfying credit of the retaken courses will supersede the precedent ones.

Example:
A first-year freshmen student in Computer Science has taken four classes in his first-semester at George Mason University: CS 112, MATH 113, ENGH 101, and COMM 100. He has earned an A-, B+, A, and A for those classes in that respective order. Below is an example of how the classes are calculated. 

ClassCreditsGradeTotal Quality Points (TQP)CS 1124A- (3.67)4*3.67 = 14.68MATH 1134B+ (3.33)4*3.33 = 13.32ENGH 1013A (4.00)3*4.00 = 12.00COMM 1003A (4.00)3*4.00 = 12.00TOTAL144 courses52TOTAL TQP: 14.68+13.32+12.00+12.00 = 52
Total Attempted: 14 credits
Total Earned: 14 credits 

Cumulative GPA: Total TQP/Total Number of Attempted Credit Hours
Cumulative GPA = 52/14
Cumulative GPA = 3.714

In summary, this student has a cumulative GPA of 3.714. 






OPTION 1: GPA Generator
Use this option if you would like to generate your GPA and have yet to enter any information into the system (Option 1). When option 1 is typed into the main menu, the program will then request you to enter your George Mason Net ID. 

Note if your Net ID already exists in the system, the program will inform you to exit this option and select other options available. Otherwise, the program will proceed to ask you to enter your G-Number. 

Note the following conventions when typing into GPA Generator option. 
- The Net ID should only have letters and numbers (no special characters). 
- The G-Number should contain all numeric values following the letter “G”. However, for this version of the program – any character will do. 

Once entered the credentials, enter the numeric value for the number of classes you would like to enter for calculating your initial cumulative GPA. Note entering any other character besides a numeric value may cause the program to run improperly. 
 

Figure 2 – GPA Generator Option; entering information




Figure 3 – Entering your class information and grade

Afterwards, you will then be prompted to enter the information for each class you wish to request. For example, if you want to enter information for two classes, you will type information for each of the two classes. 

The program will display the current course number you are providing to help you keep track of each class (Figure 3 – e.g. “Course 1 of 2”). After you entered your first class into the system, the system will then display what class you have already entered for your convenience (Figure 4). 

When you enter information for each course, type the associated class code (the course abbreviation and the associated number – e.g. CDS 130, ENGH 101), the associated number of credit hours for that course (as a numeric value), and the grade for the class. Press Enter after each prompt from the program. 

Note the system only recognizes grades A+, A, A-, B+, B, B-, C+, C, C-, D, F, W (withdraw) and I (incomplete). Other grades marks such as S/NC (Satisfactory or No Credit) or T (transfer) are not recognized in this version of the program, and thus you should not put in any classes that have these grade marks. In addition, check the credit hours for each course to ensure hours are entered properly. Otherwise, you may not get a proper GPA calculation. 


Figure 4 – Entering your class information and grade for subsequent courses
Once all classes have entered, the system will display the cumulative GPA rounded to the nearest thousandth value. In addition, the system will display the number of attempted and earned credits you have received as well as the courses you have entered for your convenience. Note these calculations as well as your courses are save into the system, so they are readily available in other options. 

After reading through the message, press ENTER to exit this option and return to main menu (Figure 5). 


Figure 5 – Confirmation screen and cumulative GPA calculation.


OPTION 2: GPA Update
Use this option if you would like to update your GPA calculation with additional classes or classes that are retaken. Classes retaken include classes that originally have a grade of “F”, “W”, and grades that do not meet the prerequisite for another classes (i.e. for most cases it is a C- or D. For verification, check with your advisor about policies pertaining to you.) When option 2 is typed into the main menu, the program will then request you to enter your George Mason Net ID. 

Note if your Net ID is not in the system, the program will inform you to exit this option. You will need to select option 1 to generate your GPA first before using option 2. If you already entered your Net ID in option 1, ensure you entered your Net ID exactly as it was entered. 

Once entered a valid Net ID, enter the numeric value for the number of classes you would like to enter (for additional classes or classes that are retaken for subsequent attempts) for calculating your cumulative GPA. Note entering any other character besides a numeric value may cause the program to run improperly. 
 






Figure 6 – Entering your class information and grade in GPA Update

You will then be prompted to enter the information for each class you wish to request. For example, if you want to enter information for two classes, you will type information for each of the two classes. 

The program will display all courses already entered into the system before you selected this option under the list called “There is/are X course(s) already entered into the system:”. Note if you used GPA update previously, classes entered during that instance will display too. Just like in GPA generator, the program will display the current course number you are providing to help you keep track of each class (e.g. “Course 1 of 2”). After you entered your first class into the system (either as an additional/subsequent class or a retaken one), the system will then display what class you have already entered for your convenience (Figure 6). For classes that are retaken, the course code will display in both “already entered” and “just entered/updated” (Figure 6).

For classes that you have retaken, you will only need to enter the updated grade as the program already has the number of credit hours associated with that retaken class. The system will replace the existing grade with the grade you have just entered. Classes that have had the “I” designation in the system will have their GPA recalculated as if the student took the class for the first time. 

For cases where you would like to add additional classes, then you enter information for each course, type the associated class code (the course abbreviation and the associated number – e.g. CDS 130, ENGH 101), the associated number of credit hours for that course (as a numeric value), and the grade for the class. Press Enter after each prompt from the program. 

Note the system only recognizes grades A+, A, A-, B+, B, B-, C+, C, C-, D, F, W (withdraw) and I (incomplete). Other grades marks such as S/NC (Satisfactory or No Credit) or T (transfer) are not recognized in this version of the program, and thus you should not put in any classes that have these grade marks. In addition, check the credit hours for each course to ensure hours are entered properly. Otherwise, you may not get a proper GPA calculation. 


Figure 7 – Confirmation screen and cumulative GPA calculation.

Once all classes have entered, the system will display the cumulative GPA rounded to the nearest thousandth value (Figure 7). In addition, the system will display the number of attempted and earned credits you have received as well as the courses you have entered/updated for your convenience. Note these calculations as well as your courses are save into the system, so they are readily available in other options. 

After reading through the message, press ENTER to exit this option and return to main menu (Figure 5). 

OPTION 3: GPA Retrieve 
Use this option if you would like to retrieve your GPA calculation and all classes entered as a report. When option 3 is typed into the main menu, the program will then request you to enter your George Mason Net ID. 

Note if your Net ID is not in the system, the program will inform you to exit this option. You will need to select option 1 to generate your GPA first before using option 3. If you already entered your Net ID in option 1, ensure you entered your Net ID exactly as it was entered (Figure 8). 


Figure 8 – Enter a valid Net ID for retrieving your GPA information.   

Once entered a valid Net ID, the system will generate a report containing the cumulative GPA, attempted and earned credits, number of courses entered, and a listing of all courses entered into the system with grades (Figure 9). The report also provides the undergraduate GPA equivalent scale for your convenience.


Figure 9 – The GPA Retrieval Report 

If you wish to export your report as a text file, type exactly “Y” or “Yes” after the prompt “Do you wish to export this report?”. If you do so, the program will notify user if exporting was done successfully. Please note the report does not replace a transcript. Note that the report should be created in the same folder as this program. The name of that exported file, as a text (.txt file) will contain your Net ID in the file name. For example, the exported file name will be “jsmith10GPAexport.txt”.

Whether you choose to export the report or not, press ENTER to exit this option when finish viewing the report (or after prompt). This returns you to the main menu (Figure 10 – See next page). 

Figure 10 – The program notifies the user that the report has been exported.


Figure 11 – The program tells user to exit option after viewing (if exporting file was not selected by the user).

OPTION 4: GPA Deletion
Use this option if you would like to delete your GPA calculation and all classes entered as a report. When option 4 is typed into the main menu, the program will then request you to enter your George Mason Net ID. 

Note if your Net ID is not in the system, the program will inform you to exit this option. You will need to select option 1 to generate your GPA first before using option 4. If you already entered your Net ID in option 1, ensure you entered your Net ID exactly as it was entered (Figure 8). 

Once Net ID is entered successfully, the Net ID and G-Number is displayed along with the important notice. Read the notice thoroughly. Note that once record is deleted it is not recoverable; you will need to go to option 1 – GPA Generator – to recreate your record if you decide to generate another cumulative GPA calculation. If you wish to delete your record, type exactly “Yes”. You will be asked to enter your Net ID. If you respond as “No” or any other word besides “Yes”, the user will be returned to the main menu (Figure 12). 




Figure 12 – The program tells user about deletion notice, and asks if user would like to delete the user’s record. 

Once Net ID is entered successfully, the program will ask again to seek your confirmation about deleting your record. If you firmly wish to delete your record, type exactly “Yes”. You will be asked to enter your Net ID once more. If you respond as “No” or any other word besides “Yes”, the user will be returned to the main menu (Figure 13). 


Figure 13 – The program asks user to confirm user’s deletion choice. 

Once you enter your Net ID to firmly delete your record from the system permanently, the program will inform you that your record was successfully removed. Afterwards, you will be returned to the main menu (Figure 14). 


Figure 14 – The program informs user that user’s record has been deleted.


Exit – When You Are Done Using the GPA Generator and Retrieval System
When you wish to exit the program, select option 5 from the main menu. At that point, the program will save all student records entered into the system into a binary file. The binary file should be created in the same folder as this program.

Then, the program informs you that the program is terminating. You need to press “ENTER” to successfully end the program. When done so, the window closes (Figure 15). 

Please note that you DO NOT delete the binary file, which is named Student_GPA_Info.dat. This program will use the file to retrieve the data saved from past sessions so that you can update or retrieve GPA and associated information in the future. Deleting the file will cause data to be lost.
